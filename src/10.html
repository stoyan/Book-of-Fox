          Firefox OS is open source so you can build it yourself. In fact, at the time of writing it's really hard to get access to a phone with preinstalled OS so you might have to do it even if you're not especially ecstatic about it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
          You can build the OS and install it on many phones that support Android 4. In this chapter you'll see a walk-through building for two phones - Nexus S 4G and Galaxy Nexus.

            The Firefox OS prerequisites page (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites</a>) list a number of supported phones grouped into tiers. Tier 1 is the most supported one with phones such as Keon, Unagi, Inagi and so on, which are the hardest to find.

            Tier 2 includes Nexus S and Nexus S 4g by Samsung. Tier 2 means not everything is actively tested. If you can get hold of one of these phones, that would be preferable to tier 3. Tier 3 is Galaxy S2 and Galaxy Nexus. These phones have on-screen home button which is not supported by Firefox OS. This means that, unfortunately you can't close an app once it's open. However toward the end of the chapter you'll see a hack that helps with this problem.

          Your development OS
        </h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            You can develop apps and hack on Gaia using any type of computer OS for your development. However for building the Firefox OS it's highly recommended that you use Linux and more specifically Ubuntu 12.04. (Theoretically you can build on a Mac as well, but be aware that the author has spent a significant hours failing to do so.)
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            The good news is that Ubuntu is free. It's Linux-based free operating system and the recommended 12.04 is the latest of the stable 12 branch which is guaranteed to be supported until 2017.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            If you're already running this OS, great news. If you're not, it's best if you find a Windows machine and install Ubuntu on it, either replacing Windows or together with it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            In this chapter let's assume you've never seen Ubuntu before. If you have, feel free to skip the more trivial parts.

            The process is simple - download the OS, burn it to a CD and install it - but each of these steps can take a while.

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            Burn the ISO image file you downloaded to a CD. On a Mac use the built-in "Disk Utility". Windows also has a built-in "Disc Image Burner" program.

            Note that because of the different screen resolution everything may look smaller. This appears to be a CSS media query issue related to "retina" display and will be solved eventually.

          <p>
            Another phone you can use to experiment is Samsung Galaxy Nexus. It's a Tier 3 device, meaning it may behave worse than The Nexus S. But you can still use it to test the real OS on a real device.

          <p>
            Indeed, Galaxy Nexus doesn't have a working hardware Home button which makes testing really difficult, as you can only open a single app and cannot close it. However, there's a workaround including you hacking the Gaia UI. You'll see how in a moment. Let's get started flashing the Galaxy Nexus.

            After you're done building and flashing, you can see that you already have a copy of Gaia inside your B2G directory, e.g.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="listingblock">
          <div>
            <pre>
$ ls ~/B2G/gaia/apps/browser

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            You can edit the files in the <code>gaia</code> directory and flash only the Gaia part to the phone. Let's give it a quick try by changing a simple text.

            <li>
              <p>
                Double-click the file <code>browser.en-US.properties</code> which contains the English texts

            <li>
              <p>
                Change something, for example the text for the property called <code>enter-search-or-address.placeholder</code>

            <li>
              <p>
                Go back to the Terminal, make sure the phone is connected and type

            This only copies the Gaia part of the OS, not the whole thing. You'll see some messages flying by and then your phone will restart. Then you can see the effect of your changes:

              At this point you're done with building the Firefox OS (B2G) and installing it on an Android phone. From now on you can use this phone for regular application testing (with the B2G2R2D2 extension) or Gaia hacking.

          <div class="paragraph">

              For Gaia hacking, you can review the previous chapter. You can go back to your regular development environment (assuming you installed Ubuntu just for building the OS and your regular development is on a different machine)

              If you want to copy your modified version of Gaia you no longer need to use <code>flash.sh</code>, you can navigate to your Gaia directory and run <code>make install-gaia</code>.

          Closing apps on Galaxy Nexus
        </h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            As you've already seen while playing on Galaxy Nexus, you can't close apps because the Home button doesn't work. Here's a little hack you can use to add the ability to close apps from the sleep menu.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            The sleep menu appears when you press and hold the power button. Let's add another option in this menu. Let's assume you're still on the Ubuntu desktop you used to build B2G. Note however that all you need is Gaia.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            First, choose Home Folder on the desktop and navigate to B2G/gaia/apps/system. Find the file <code>sleep_menu.js</code> and double click. It opens in the built-in text editor.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            Find the function <code>generateItems()</code>. Before it returns, you need to add another item to the <code>items</code> array:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="listingblock">
          <div>
            <pre>
items.push({label: 'home', value: 'goHome'});
</pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            This adds the new menu item. Now you need to handle clicks (taps) on this menu option. Find the function <code>handler()</code>. It's one big <code>switch</code> statement. Add another case at the end of that <code>switch</code> statement.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="listingblock">
          <div>
            <pre>
case 'goHome':
  var current_app = WindowManager.getDisplayedApp();
  if (current_app) {
    WindowManager.kill(current_app);
  }
  break;
</pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            Save the file and push the changes to the phone:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="listingblock">
          <div>
            <pre>
$ cd ~/B2G/gaia
$ make install-gaia
</pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            The result when you start an app and then press and hold the Power button:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="listingblock">
          <div>
            <pre>
[[[screenshto]]]
</pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            Tap "home" and the application closes.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            Now you've significantly improved your Firefox OS testing experience on Galaxy Nexus.
